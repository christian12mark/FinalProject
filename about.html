                            <p>The Mount Carmel College of Baler (Kolehiyong Monte Carmelo ng Baler in Filipino), commonly referred to as MCC Baler or MCCB, is the oldest Catholic mission school in the Philippine province of Aurora.
                             It was founded in 1948 by the American Carmelites, who arrived in Baler upon the invitation of Do√±a Aurora Aragon-Quezon (1888-1949), former First Lady of the Philippines (1935-1944), wife of the late Philippine Commonwealth President Manuel Luis Quezon. 
                             It is currently a member of the Catholic Association of Schools in the Prelature of Infanta (CASPI).
